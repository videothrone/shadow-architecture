# Shadow Architecture

"Shadow Architecture" is my final project for [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/). The project was done in about a week and is a single-page React website, that shows curated "abandoned places" in Berlin via the Google Maps API.

## Demo

## Tech

HTML, CSS, Node.js / Express, React, React Hooks, Bundle.js, react-google-maps, Google Maps API

## Features

-   Users can check out twelve different locations, either by clicking on the markers on the map or by scrolling down and clicking on a location card.

-   The map's info window shows a thumbnail and short description, users can click on the icon and will be redirected to a Google route tab, where they can enter their location. They can also click on "Explore more..." which opens up an overlay with more content.

-   The overlay can also be accessed by clicking on the location cards and presents a bigger image, which can be enlarged by clicking on it. It also includes more information about the place and another route redirect icon.

## Goals while doing the project

-   Plan and execute an substantial and actionable idea of choice in a week

-   Get to know the Google Maps API, including working with the react-google-maps NPM package, customizing the design and the UI to a certain aesthetic choice

-   Make a "slick" and modular React based site that's working fine on Desktop and most mobile devices and can be extended easily further down the line

-   Pull all content dynamically from a central JSON file and handle the subsequent design challenges

## Future

-   Nicer / more custom mobile responsiveness on certain devices (tablets f.e.)

-   Add more places and content

-   More map functionality
